    <p class="callout">“Yes. They are awesome! Not only are they relaxed and cool, but they are also good at teaching and since there is more than one instructor, we get insights on all. I think that the teaching strategy was good on the education level and I like how they gave us breaks to organize our thoughts and I also thought that having two classes a week for a couple weeks before the actual SAT was a fabulous idea otherwise I would not have been able to comprehend anything. I also liked how they gave us homework so that we know exactly what to practice. The fact that there are different classes focusing on different subjects was very effective.”</p>

    <p class="callout"> <br />“I LOVED the instructors at EqualOP; I came to know some of them as friends and effective teachers. I could depend on them to help me with questions and to keep class lively when it began to get more detail oriented. I felt that the strategy of notes and the instruction throughout the problems was helpful, because the instructors went more in depth for problems that I struggled. The most striking feature is that help for all categories in math and language is offered, and the one on one teaching that is available, due to the ample amount of teachers.”</p>

    <p class="callout">“The SAT classes helped me a lot with my life and my test taking strategies and how I look at my tests. The instructors are very friendly and helpful for what we need to do in our lives. They have taught me things that I can now use and that will help me with my tests. There are so many teachers that are here to help us and each one of them teaches a different subject."</p>
